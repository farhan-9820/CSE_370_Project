# Thesis Management and Information Website

**Supervisor Selection**

_Students view a list of supervisors, their current thesis acceptance status (e.g., accepting new students or not), and available slots._

---

**Group Formation**
_Students can view other students' profiles and form a group based on their interest. After that, they can request supervisors to book slots._

---

**Slot Booking**

_Groups can request supervisors for their thesis. There would be a limit on the number of requesting supervisors. After requesting, supervisors can view the groups and students that have requested to supervise. The supervisor can accept or reject the request. The supervisor can only accept if it does not cross their group limit. Upon approval, all the other requests by that group would be removed._

---

**Student Profile and Gradesheet Sharing**

_Students submit profiles, including GitHub links and gradesheets, for supervisors to review before accepting them. Supervisors view these details when evaluating slot requests or thesis assignments._

---

**Thesis File Submission**

_Students upload thesis-related files (PDF, LaTeX, etc.) for supervisor review. Submissions trigger notifications to supervisors, who can respond via email or dashboard comments. Files are versioned for tracking._

---

**Group Consultation Scheduling**

_Student groups (e.g., thesis project teams) schedule consultations with supervisors, specifying durations (20–60 minutes). Bookings update all group members’ schedules and notify the supervisor._

---

**Supervisor Feedback System**

_Supervisors provide feedback on theses or group work via dashboard comments or email. Feedback triggers notifications to students, who can respond in a threaded discussion format (Discord-like)._

---

**Thesis Search Wrapper**

_Students and supervisors search recent theses from the university’s existing thesis repository (via a wrapper API). Search supports filters by title, author, or year, displaying metadata and links to original records. They are also able to register for their P3 thesis inside the website._

**AI-Powered Workflow Assistant**

_An AI feature (using a free API like Hugging Face’s Transformers for text summarization) summarizes thesis abstracts, balances supervisor workloads by suggesting slot allocations, and generates draft feedback for supervisors. The AI integrates with the system via a wrapper API_.
